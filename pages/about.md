Welcome to **Smithers Skill Swap**, where old traditions meet new ideas, and neighbors become teachers, students, and lifelong friends.

Here in the heart of the Appalachian mountains, we believe that everyone has something worth sharing â€” whether itâ€™s how to fix a garden fence, bake the perfect cornbread, code a new app, or start a backyard herb garden. Our community thrives on the simple idea that learning together makes us stronger, more creative, and more connected.

## What we do

At Smithers Skill Swap, we bring folks together to **exchange skills, knowledge, and stories**. Our events and workshops are open to anyone â€” from first-time beginners to seasoned experts. If you can show it, tell it, or build it, thereâ€™s a place for you here.

From local craft nights to coding meet-ups, from Appalachian herbal medicine talks to digital marketing crash courses, we create spaces where curiosity and kindness are the only entry fees.

### Our Appalachian spirit

Weâ€™re inspired by the **resilience, warmth, and artistry** that run deep in these mountains. Our gatherings honor that legacy, celebrating handmade crafts, sustainable living, and the power of face-to-face connection in a fast-paced, digital world.
